# Advanced Folder Code Organization

Folders are listed in alphabetical order, not in the order they are taught in the course.

## Button Interrupt

`button-interrupt/exercise/src/main.rs` contains the project code skeleton
`button-interrupt/solution/src/main.rs` contains the solution for the first step of the exercise.
`button-interrupt/solution/src/main_led.rs` contains the solution for the second step of the exercise. 
## I2C Driver exercise (WIP)

`i2c-driver/exercise/src/icm42670p.rs` will be gap text of a very basic i2c IMU sensor driver. The task is to complete the file, so that running `main.rs` will log the device ID of the driver. The this gap text driver is based on the version of the same name that lives in common, but provides a little bit more functionality.

`i2c-driver/exercise/src/main.rs` will contain working code. Running it without modifying the driver file will yield errors. 

`i2c-driver/solution/src/icm42670p.rs` provides a solution to the task. 

## I2C Sensor Reading Exercise (WIP)

 `i2c-sensor-reading/exercise/src/main.rs` will be an exercise skeleton that will build. The task is to use an existing driver from crates.io to read out the temperature and humidity sensor over i2c. After that, a second sensor will be read out over the same i2c bus using `shared-bus`. The driver for the second sensor is available locally in `common/`.

`i2c-sensor-reading/solution/src/main.rs` contains a working solution.
